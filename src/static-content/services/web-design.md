Being online can increase your conversion rates because your business is accessible to various markets. Having a great design is a no brainer. However, I have come across many websites that:

#### *Don’t have a clear brand message*
An unclear message will attract the wrong audience making it very difficult for you to make sales. Customers want to interact with businesses that understand them.

#### *Disorganised and cluttered layout*
A lack of white space creates confusion. A confused customer will fail to understand how your brand helps them. Therefore, leaving your website and refusing to do business with you.

#### *Users get lost when navigating the page*
Customers come to your page for answers to their problems. So they want to be able to find the right page quickly. They become discouraged and leave your site if they have difficulty finding what they need.

#### *Don’t follow design best practices*
Poor choice of fonts, colours, images leave the impression that a website has been built quickly. And a lack of uniformity within headings and margins shows a lack of cohesion demonstrating a lack of vision and direction of your brand. 

#### *Don’t follow programming best practices*
Poorly written and unoptimized code is prone to bugs that can potentially slow down your website or app. User bounce rate drastically increases if your page load time exceeds 3s and having critical bugs on your website or app can disrupt its user experience or even damage your reputation.
