# **Spotify clone**

This project was built for educational purposes.

It replicates Spotify's user interface along with some of its functionality. You can log into your Spotify account via this app, access your playlists, play songs, adjust volume, etc.

Due to Spotify WebAPI limitations at the time, this app essentially works as a remote control for your original Spotify app/website. Because of it, you would have to log into your Spotify app, play a song, pause it, and only then use this clone. Unfortunately, you must have a Premium Spotify account to control your playlists or songs remotely. As Spotify WebAPI still appears to be in beta, there might be some other bugs, such as fast forward/rewind buttons not working.

Tech stack used:

- Spotify WebAPI
- NextJS
- React
- Recoil
- NextAuth
- Typescript
- TailwindCSS
